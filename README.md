# Summary

This aim of this project is to build a simple credit model using bank data from UCI. The goal is to get to a good model which runs end-to-end and play with some considerations as if we where to put it into production. This is a fun exercise and is more about skills development that ``real ML'' so we do not focus too much on the model but more the thought process behind building it.

## Data source

The original data is [Bank Marketing Data Set from UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00222/](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00222/). This was added to this git repo in order to create an end-point to query throughout development.
